                Fed up with the high prices that agencies quoted, Bibli started to look for alternatives, and found us. Given the
                nascent stage Bibli was in, we advised them to go for contractual hires instead of full-time. In just 2 weeks, they
                onboarded two dream developers who deeply understood their mission and challenges!
